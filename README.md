# mastermind
A mastermind game for The Odin Project.

In pseudocoding this project, I've decided to start with simpler iterations before building up to the full version of mastermind.

Version one will assume that only four colors can be used, red, yellow, green, and blue. No color can be repeated. It's assumed that each set of colors will be randomly generated. The player has infinite guesses.

Version two will allow there to be two players--one who guesses and one who creates the code.
